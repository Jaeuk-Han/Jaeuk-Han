## About Me

Hello! My name is Jaeuk Han, an undergraduate student at Gachon University majoring in AI and Software.  
I am passionate about **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Information Retrieval**, and **Reinforcement Learning**.  

I enjoy exploring how language technologies can be applied to both academic and real-world problems.  
In particular, I am working on projects such as:  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems** for Korean language tasks  
- **Pok√©mon-themed AI agents** that combine LLMs with reinforcement learning environments  
- **Data collection and preprocessing pipelines** using crawling, parsing, and dataset building  

Beyond technical skills, I am also interested in how AI can support cultural and creative fields.  
For example, I have built datasets around **traditional Korean brewing culture** and used them to design  
interactive demos for educational and research purposes.  

My long-term goal is to become a researcher and developer who bridges technology and culture,  
contributes to open-source communities, and continuously shares knowledge through GitHub, Kaggle, and blogging.
